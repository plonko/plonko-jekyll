Cleveland needed a searchable map to highlight its businesses and attractions. We built a great looking map which reflected the city's vibrant branding, and used Elastic Search on top of our geo-database to manage the search. I was responsible for all the frontend interaction with Elastic Search - sending search terms, receiving results and displaying them; and I also wrote unit tests using Mocha.
