HTML5 scroll path journey to tell the brand story of the Skullcandy Supreme Sound range. A looped path follows a headphone cable on a journey through product features, brand ambassadors and hero products. Along the way there are videos, wallpaper and music downloads.

Canvas rotations and bezier curve path movements elevate this HTML5 experience. This website harnessed brand new techniques and was first to market with these. Mouse tracking parallax lens flare elements on the ambassadors add another level of depth to these screens.

Take the Supreme Sound journey here

I made a prototype to test for performance, and most of the front end build. I translated the vector path designed in Illustrator to a set of instructions for Canvas, and built the site as per the designs.
