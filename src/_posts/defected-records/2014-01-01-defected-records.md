I lead the front end build and QA, specifing what frameworks and technologies to use. I created IA diagrams, a functional specification and wireframes. I also specifically built the front end for the slide editor, which was based on Django admin and allowed the content manager to see what the multi-box slides would look like as they were putting them together. Later we built a full e-commerce implementation for them using Django Oscar, an opensource ecom framework for Django.
