This site was made with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), via a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) [generator](https://github.com/sondr3/generator-jekyllized).

I used the Bourbon.io family of Sass libraries for fun: [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/), [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) and [Bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.io/), and designed it in [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/).
